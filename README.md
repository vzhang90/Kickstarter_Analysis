## Overview of Project

Louise is an up-and-coming playwright, whose recent first-ever crowdfunding campaign for her play *Fever* came close to reaching the $10,000 initially estimated goal. Despite not achieving her fundraising goal in a short amount of time, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 

This project's main purpose is to analyze the data with Excel to organize, sort, and analyze crowdfunding data to determine whether there are specific factors that make a project's campaign successful.

From analyzing data on the outcomes based on goals, it can be concluded there tends to be a negative correlation between percentage successful and percentage failed. As the goal amount increases, the overall percentage successful decreases while the overall percentage failed increases.

Throughout analyzing this Kickstarter_Analysis.x, this data set can be challenging in its lack of further trend analysis. With the two month surge in Successful Theater Outcomes by Launch Date, it would be highly recommended to further analyze the correlation between Outcomes and Years with T-tests. Visually, it would be highly recommended to included a correlation co-efficient and trend line associated with each legend.
