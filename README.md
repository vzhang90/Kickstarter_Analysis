## Overview of Project

Louise is an up-and-coming playwright, whose recent first-ever crowdfunding campaign for her play *Fever* came close to reaching her $10,000 initially estimated goal. Despite not reaching her fundraising goal in a short amount of time, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 

This project's main purpose is to analyze the data with Excel to organize, sort, and analyze crowdfunding data to determine whether there are specific factors that make a project's campaign successful.

The Theater Outcomes vs Launch line chart showed the outcomes based on a function of time:
The Outcomes vs Goals line chart visualized the data of the outcomes based on pledge goals.

Challenges and difficulties encountered with analyzing Louise's data into a visualization

Analyzing the Kickstarter data by Theater Outcomes based on Launch Date worksheet indicated an increase in successful in May and June. The 

From analyzing data on the outcomes based on goals, it can be concluded there tends to be a negative correlation between percentage successful and percentage failed. As the goal amount increases, the overall percentage successful decreases while the overall percentage failed increases.

Looking forward and further, this data set can be limited in the lack of further trend analysis.
